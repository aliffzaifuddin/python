# Notes

## Python collections

- List: A list is a collection of ordered, mutable data. The lists are declared with square brackets.
 - Example, list = [1, 4, "foo", -6, "bark"]

- Tuples: A tuple is an ordered, immutable collection of data. Tuples are enclosed within parentheses.
 - Example, tuple = (1,2,"college",9)

- Sets: A set is an unordered, mutable collection with no duplicates data. Sets are represented in curly brackets.
 - Example, set = {1,2,3,4,5,"hello","tup"}

- Dictionaries: A dictionary is an unordered, mutable collection of data that stores data in key-value pairs. Dictionaries are enclosed in curly brackets in the form of key-value pairs.
 - Example, dict = { fruit1 : "apple" , fruit2 : "cherry" , fruit3 : "strawberry" }
